Given "the user hasn't started the program yet"
When "the user starts the program"
Then "an empty 5*5 grid appears"
And "the user is prompted for coordinates and direction"

Given "the user has started the program"
When "the user inputs the coordinates and direction"
Then "the display is updated with the position of the rover"
And "the display is updated with the direction of the rover"
